                    <h1>About Studies :</h1>
                    <p>Born in New Delhi, Gandhi spent his early childhood between Delhi and Dehradun and stayed away
                        from the public sphere for much of his childhood and early youth. He received primary education
                        in New Delhi and then attended The Doon School in Dehradun. However, due to security concerns,
                        he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree at St. Stephen's College
                        before moving to Harvard University. The following year, due to security threats following the
                        assassination of his father, he moved to Rollins College in Florida, completing his degree in
                        1994. The next year, he obtained his M.Phil. from Cambridge. After completing his
                        post-graduation, he initiated his professional career with the Monitor Group, a management
                        consulting firm in London. Soon thereafter, he returned to India and founded Backops Services
                        Private Ltd, a technology outsourcing firm based in Mumbai. </p>
