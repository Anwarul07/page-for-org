                    <div class="about"> He began his undergraduate career at Delhi’s St. Stephen’s College before moving
                        to Harvard
                        University in the USA.
                        Rahul Gandhi graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in 1994. The year after, he obtained his M. Phil
                        from Trinity College, Cambridge. In 2013, Rahul Gandhi was elected as the Vice-President of the
                        Congress Party. Within the Congress party, Rahul Gandhi played the key role of channeling the
                        party along the lines of Congress’ core principles.He tirelessly worked to democratise the
                        student wing and youth wing of the Congress party and ensured a breath of fresh air entered the
                        grand old party by encouraging young leaders to take up leadership positions. His pivotal role
                        in shaping the party along Congress’ core values over his political career earned him the post
                        of President of the Congress Party in 2017. Under Rahul Gandhi’s guidance, the Congress Party
                        has once again emerged as the voice of the nation.
