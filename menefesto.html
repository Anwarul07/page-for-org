                <h1>Forwarded by Rahul Gandhi</h1>
                <h3>Election 2024 presents a stark choice to the people of India.</h3>
                <div class="text">
                    <p class="flex">Will India be a free and democratic country, and will the people of India be free from fear, free
                        to live, work, pray, eat, love and marry according to their wishes; be free from poverty, and
                        free to pursue their ambitions? Or will India be governed by a pernicious ideology that will
                        trample upon people’s rights, our institutions, conventions and the healthy differences that are
                        the essence of a multi-cultural country? </p>
                    <br><br>

                            Will India be able to lift all our people with the tide of growth, and will it get rid of
                            poverty - or, will India become a country marked by gross inequalities of income, wealth and
                            power?

                            The last 5 years have been disastrous for the people of India. The youth have lost jobs.
                            Farmers
                            have lost hope. Traders have lost business. Micro, small and medium enterprises have lost
                            their
                            confidence. Women have lost the sense of security. Deprived communities have lost their
                            traditional rights. Institutions have lost independence.
                            <br><br>

                            false statistics and an overall climate of fear, intimidation and hatred.

                            In this time of deep crisis, the Indian National Congress promises a clean break from the
                            past 5
                            years. With this manifesto, the Congress offers to you the only national alternative: a
                            distinct
                            <br><br>
                            prosperity for our people. We promise to make India strong and united, and a just and
                            prosperous
                            society.

                            Our manifesto process reflects our commitment to a higher vision - that of listening to the
                            Jan
                            Awaaaz. It is not the ‘mann ki baat’ of one individual but the collective voice of lakhs of
                            people.

                            I have personally been listening to people’s voices from all corners of our country. Every
                            single word in the Congress manifesto reflects your voices and the aspirations of crores of
                            Indians. It is an action plan for the future of India. You inspired this manifesto. It is a
                            living manifesto. Now, it needs your support and your vote.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                    <p>We will present a report to the people of India, every year, on the status of implementation of our
                        manifesto. We will also set up an independent social audit group, which will make its own assessment
                        of how and to what extent we have fulfilled our promises.</p>
