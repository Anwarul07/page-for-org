                    <p>It is the vision of Congress President, Rahul Gandhi, to ensure that women have an equal place in
                        our society. His focus has remained on ensuring their workforce participation increases and they
                        receive greater representation in the political process. He has consistently advocated and
                        worked towards the empowerment of women and has taken measures to ensure the same. One of his
                        most significant steps was to initiate the system of Self-Help Groups amongst the women in the
                        villages of Amethi. The primary focus of this scheme was to bring women together and empower
                        them with information and decision making capabilities. Through Rajiv Gandhi Mahila Vikas
                        Pariyojana (RGMVP), the women are imparted with skills in leadership, education, fundamental
                        rights, health and self defence, all of which enables them to become far more independent and
                        empowered. SHGs were envisioned to reach out to the last person in the line and to percolate
                        down to the most interior areas. They are designed as a three tier structure, i.e, SHGs within a
                        village with 10-20 women, village level consisting of around 10 SHGs and the block level which
                        is a federation of the village level SHGs.</p>

                <p>In 2010, Rahul Gandhi brought Microsoft founder and philanthropist, Bill Gates, to the district of
                    Amethi to shine a light on the growing development work in the region. The pair visited various
                    schools, hospitals, the IGEHRC eye care camps and a group of SHGs to speak to women about their
                    needs and development issues. This visit helped popularise the SHG scheme and highlight the
                    incredible work these women do in villages around the district.

                    SHGs mainly work in areas of financial stability and inclusion, livelihood promotion, health care
                    and access to government schemes.</p>
